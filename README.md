# Tic Tac Toe Game Project

## Overview
For my first project at General Assembly, I was asked to build a Single Page Application for the web allowing one user to play Tic Tac Toe against another user.

My User Stories for this project are as follows:

  1. Only registered users can play Tic Tac Toe
  2. As a user, I want to be able to register for Tic Tac Toe with my email and a password.
  3. As a user once registered, I want to be able to log in to play.
  4. As a user, I want to be able to change my password once logged in.
  5. As a user, I want to click on a cell and see either x or o appear.
  6. As a user, I want to be unable to select:
+      - the same cell twice
+      - 2 X's or 2 O's in a row (must alternate)
+      - more than 9 selections in the same game
  7. As a user, I want to see my score on the screen after each game.
  8. As a user, I want to decide whether to play again after a game is complete.
  9. As a user, I want to retrieve a list of game statistics.
  10. As a user, I want to be able to update game statistics
  11. As a user, I want to be able to log out of the game.

## Technologies Used

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
- `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard Style
- `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
- `grunt test`: runs any automated tests, depends on `grunt build`
- `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
