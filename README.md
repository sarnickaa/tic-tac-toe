# Tic Tac Toe Game Project

## Overview

My first project at General Assembly is a Single Page Application for the web allowing a user to play Tic Tac Toe.

My User Stories for this project are as follows:

  1. Only registered users can play Tic Tac Toe
  2. As a user, I want to be able to register for Tic Tac Toe with my email and a password.
  3. As a user once registered, I want to be able to log in to play.
  4. As a user, I want to be able to change my password once logged in.
  5. As a user, I want to click on a cell and see either x or o appear.
  6. As a user, I want to be unable to select the same cell twice, 2 X's or 2 O's in a row (must alternate) or have more than 9 selections in the same game
  7. As a user, I want to see my score on the screen after each game.
  8. As a user, I want to decide whether to play again after a game is complete.
  9. As a user, I want to retrieve a list of game statistics.
  10. As a user, I want to be able to log my moves.
  11. As a user, I want to be able to log out of the game.

## Technologies Used

  *HTML5
  *CSS3
  *Bootstrap
  *JavaScript
  *JQuery
  *GoogleFonts

  HTML5 was used to build the framework for the app. The app was styled with CSS and modals were created with Bootstrap.

  All game logic was written with JavaScript. JQuery was used for all DOM manipulation, view updates and AJAX calls to the API.

## Planning



## Updates

Issued that need to be resolved:

  *UX needs to be smoothed out. At present, the user is required to click a button if they would like their moves to be saved on the server.
  *Bug regarding 'game over' paramater. Is not updating according to win/loss/tie.



## Additional Functionality

In the future, I would like to include an option where the user can play against the computer.
